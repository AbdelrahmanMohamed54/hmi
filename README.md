### Exercise: Analyzing Good and Bad Designs

#### Good Design Example: A Smartphone's Home Screen
- **Discoverability**:
  - Actions are clear: Icons represent apps, and swiping reveals more screens.
  - Performing actions is intuitive: Tap to open an app, swipe for more options.
- **Understanding**:
  - Usage is straightforward: Users recognize familiar icons (camera, messages, etc.).
  - Controls and settings are accessible: Easily findable through a settings icon.
  - System state is clear: Visual indicators show battery life, signal strength, and notifications.

**Why it is good**:
- Engages System 1: Most actions are fast and intuitive.
- Minimal learning curve: Users can quickly understand and use the device.
- Consistent feedback: Users get immediate responses from their actions, reducing uncertainty.

#### Bad Design Example: A Complex Remote Control
- **Discoverability**:
  - Actions are not clear: Too many buttons with unclear labels.
  - Performing actions is confusing: Users struggle to find the right button among many similar ones.
- **Understanding**:
  - Usage is not straightforward: The remote requires users to refer to a manual frequently.
  - Controls and settings are hidden: Important functions might be buried under layers of buttons.
  - System state is ambiguous: Users often can't tell if their input has been registered or if the device is on the correct mode.

**Why it is bad**:
- Engages System 2: Requires conscious effort to remember and find functions.
- High learning curve: Users need time to learn what each button does.
- Poor feedback: Unclear if actions are successful, leading to frustration.

#### Exercises slides 2

1. **Take/find things with poor design.**
2. **Why is the design poor and how can it be improved? Use the fundamental principles we’ve learned today to build your argument. Explicitly relate to the terms/definitions from the slides/book.**

### Exercise Solutions

#### Example 1: Microwave Oven with Complex Interface

**Why is the design poor?**
- **Affordances**: The buttons and knobs do not clearly indicate their functions. Users cannot tell which buttons control time, power, or specific cooking modes without closely reading labels.
- **Signifiers**: Poorly labeled buttons and lack of visual cues make it difficult to know where to press for specific functions.
- **Constraints**: There are no physical or visual constraints to guide the user, leading to potential errors in setting time or mode.
- **Mappings**: The relationship between buttons and their effects is not intuitive. For example, a button for "popcorn" might not clearly indicate its function or how to use it.
- **Feedback**: Feedback is minimal or delayed, making it hard to know if the input has been registered or if the microwave is functioning correctly.
- **Conceptual Models**: Users often have a poor mental model of how the microwave works due to unclear instructions and labels.

**How can it be improved?**
- **Affordances**: Use clear, distinct buttons for each function with symbols or text that indicate their use (e.g., a clock icon for time setting).
- **Signifiers**: Add visual cues like icons or color coding to guide the user. For instance, a blue button for defrost, a red button for cooking.
- **Constraints**: Implement constraints by grouping buttons logically and using physical barriers or distinct sections for different functions.
- **Mappings**: Arrange the buttons in a logical layout that mirrors the sequence of operations (e.g., time setting buttons next to power level buttons).
- **Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear feedback, such as a beep when a button is pressed and a display showing the current setting.
- **Conceptual Models**: Improve the user's mental model by including a simple, visual instruction guide on the microwave door or near the control panel.

## Exercise for slide 3:

To address the exercise, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. Identify an item with a bad design.
2. Analyze why the design is bad using the 7 Stages of Action model.
3. Relate the issues to the fundamental principles of interaction.
4. Propose improvements to the design.
5. Present the analysis.

Let's go through these steps with a specific example: a poorly designed car dashboard.

### 1. Identify an Item with a Bad Design

**Example**: A Car Dashboard with Overcomplicated Controls

### 2. Analyze Why the Design is Bad Using the 7 Stages of Action Model

#### 7 Stages of Action Model:

1. **Goal: Form the Goal**
   - **Example**: The driver wants to change the radio station.
   
2. **Plan the Action**
   - **Example**: The driver plans to find the radio control panel on the dashboard.
   
3. **Specify an Action Sequence**
   - **Example**: The driver decides to press the radio button, then the station selection button.
   
4. **Perform the Action Sequence**
   - **Example**: The driver attempts to press the radio button, but struggles to find it among many similar buttons.
   
5. **Perceive the State of the World**
   - **Example**: The driver looks at the dashboard to see if the radio is on and which station is selected.
   
6. **Interpret the Perception**
   - **Example**: The driver is confused by the multiple displays and indicators, and cannot easily determine the radio's status.
   
7. **Compare the Outcome with the Goal**
   - **Example**: The driver realizes that the desired radio station was not selected and the radio might not even be turned on.

#### Where the Interaction Fails

- **Goal Formation**: Clear.
- **Planning**: The driver might plan incorrectly due to unclear controls.
- **Specification**: The action sequence is not intuitive due to poor mappings and signifiers.
- **Execution**: The driver struggles with execution because of poor affordances and constraints.
- **Perception**: The driver cannot easily perceive the state due to lack of immediate feedback and poor conceptual models.
- **Interpretation**: The driver misinterprets the state due to confusing signifiers and feedback.
- **Comparison**: The driver is unable to easily compare the outcome with the goal due to inadequate feedback and poor conceptual models.

### 3. Relate the Issues to the Fundamental Principles

- **Affordances**: The buttons do not clearly indicate their functions.
- **Signifiers**: There are no clear signifiers to indicate which buttons control the radio.
- **Constraints**: No constraints to prevent pressing the wrong button.
- **Mappings**: Poor mapping of controls to their functions; the layout does not mirror the sequence of actions.
- **Feedback**: Feedback is not immediate or informative; the driver does not know if the radio is on or which station is selected.
- **Conceptual Models**: The dashboard does not match the driver's mental model of how it should work.

### 4. Propose Improvements to the Design

- **Affordances**: Use distinct shapes and sizes for different controls. For instance, make the radio button larger and uniquely shaped.
- **Signifiers**: Add clear labels and icons to the buttons. Use backlighting or color coding to make the radio controls stand out.
- **Constraints**: Physically separate different control groups (e.g., climate control, radio control) to prevent accidental pressing.
- **Mappings**: Arrange the buttons in a logical sequence that mirrors the user's mental model of turning on the radio and selecting a station.
- **Feedback**: Provide immediate visual and auditory feedback when a button is pressed. For example, a display that shows the current radio station and status.
- **Conceptual Models**: Simplify the dashboard layout to match common user expectations. Include a quick-start guide for new users.

### 5. Present the Analysis

**Analysis of the Current Design:**

- **Problem Identification**: The car dashboard has a poor design, particularly in the radio control section.
- **7 Stages of Action Breakdown**: The interaction fails at several stages, from specifying the action sequence to interpreting the outcome.
- **Fundamental Principles**: Issues include poor affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, feedback, and conceptual models.

**Proposed Improvements:**

- **Affordances**: Distinct shapes and sizes for controls.
- **Signifiers**: Clear labels, icons, and color coding.
- **Constraints**: Separation of control groups.
- **Mappings**: Logical arrangement of controls.
- **Feedback**: Immediate and informative visual/auditory feedback.
- **Conceptual Models**: Simplified layout and quick-start guides.

### Exercise: Applying the Gestalt Principles

#### 1. Find a Bad Design

**Example**: A cluttered microwave control panel with many similar buttons.

#### 2. Analyze Why the Interaction is Misleading

**Interaction Issues**:
- **Similarity**: All buttons look the same, making it hard to distinguish functions.
- **Proximity**: Buttons are placed too close together, leading to accidental presses.
- **Closure**: Labels are cut off or incomplete, making them hard to read.
- **Simplicity**: The panel is overly complex with too many options.
- **Continuity**: Button layout does not follow a logical path, causing confusion.
- **Common Destiny**: Different functions are not grouped logically, making it hard to find related controls.
- **Familiarity**: The layout does not match common user expectations, increasing the learning curve.

**Explanation Using Gestalt Laws and Visual Features**:
- **Similarity**: Misuse of similarity makes it difficult to differentiate between buttons.
- **Proximity**: Poor proximity causes user errors due to closely placed buttons.
- **Closure**: Incomplete labels hinder user understanding.
- **Simplicity**: Overly complex design overwhelms the user.
- **Continuity**: Lack of logical flow in the button arrangement confuses the user.
- **Common Destiny**: Misalignment in grouping related controls increases the cognitive load.
- **Familiarity**: Non-standard layout increases the time to learn and use the microwave.

#### 3. Re-design

**Re-design Sketch**:
- Use a tool like Excalidraw or Draw.io to sketch the new design.

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- **Similarity**: Use distinct shapes and colors for different functions.
- **Proximity**: Space out buttons logically and avoid crowding.
- **Closure**: Ensure labels are clear and complete.
- **Simplicity**: Reduce the number of buttons to essential functions and simplify the layout.
- **Continuity**: Arrange buttons in a logical sequence (e.g., cooking modes in one row, timer settings in another).
- **Common Destiny**: Group related functions together (e.g., all cooking options in one section).
- **Familiarity**: Use a layout that matches common user expectations and standard microwave designs.

Here's a simple sketch for the redesign:

**Sketch Description**:
- The control panel has clearly labeled and distinct buttons.
- Cooking modes are grouped together and spaced out.
- Timer settings are in a separate section.
- A display screen provides immediate feedback.
- The layout follows a logical flow from left to right.

   - **Confidence Intervals**: Provide a range within which the true score likely falls.
   - **Generate Boxplots**: Visualize the distribution of scores, highlighting median, quartiles, and any outliers.

**4. Steps to Solve the Exercise**:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - **SUS**: Check that scores are on a 0-4 scale. If not, adjust accordingly.
   - **PSSUQ and AttrakDiff**: Ensure all items are correctly aligned and reversed as needed.

2. **Compute Scores**:
   - **SUS**: 
     - For each user, sum the adjusted scores of the items and multiply by 2.5 to get the final score.
   - **PSSUQ**:
     - Calculate scores for overall satisfaction and each sub-scale by averaging the responses for each set of items.
   - **AttrakDiff**:
     - Aggregate scores for each dimension from the items provided.

3. **Calculate Descriptive Statistics**:
   - **Mean**: Add up all the scores and divide by the number of responses.
   - **Standard Deviation**: Calculate the spread of scores around the mean.
   - **Confidence Intervals**: Use statistical software or formulas to determine the range.
   - **Boxplots**: Create plots to visualize score distribution using software like Excel, R, or Python.
