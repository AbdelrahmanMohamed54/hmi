## COGNITIVE BASICS

### Part a)
**What are preattentive cues, and how can they be utilized? Explain in two sentences. (3 points)**

Preattentive cues are visual properties that the human brain processes quickly and automatically without conscious effort. They can be utilized to draw attention to important information in a visual display, such as using color or size to highlight critical data points.

### Part b)
**While engaged in a phone conversation with your partner on your way home from work, you fail to notice two friends who cross your path. What is the reason for not noticing them, and what is the name given to this phenomenon? Please provide your answers in two sentences. (3 points)**

The reason for not noticing your friends is due to the limited attentional resources available when multitasking. This phenomenon is known as inattentional blindness, where attention is focused on one task and other stimuli are not perceived.

### Part c)
**To perceive our environment, our eyes are constantly moving. How do we call the „jumps“ between fixations? (1 point)**

The "jumps" between fixations are called saccades.

### Part d)
**Name three visual features from the first stage of visual perception. (3 points)**

1. Color
2. Shape
3. Movement

### Part e)
**You have been provided with 9 circles. Utilize the Law of Proximity to create three groups. Draw it here: (3 points)**

```
●●●   ●●●   ●●●
```
The Law of Proximity groups elements that are close to each other into a collective whole.

### Part f)
**You have been provided with 3 circles, 3 squares, and 3 triangles. Utilize the Law of Similarity to create three groups. Draw it here: (3 points)**

```
●●●   ■■■   ▲▲▲
```
The Law of Similarity groups elements that are similar in shape or other attributes.

### Part g)
**What does C.R.A.P. stand for? (4 points)**
C: Contrast  
R: Repetition  
A: Alignment  
P: Proximity  

### Part h)
**Which C.R.A.P. principles can you identify in the given screenshot? Provide an example for each principle. (4 points)**

Without the actual screenshot, here are examples of what each principle might look like:

1. **Contrast:** The use of different colors to distinguish headings from body text.
2. **Repetition:** Consistent use of font styles and sizes throughout the document.
3. **Alignment:** Text and images are aligned along a common edge, creating a clean, orderly appearance.
4. **Proximity:** Related items are grouped together, reducing visual clutter and emphasizing relationships.

### Part i)
**What is the SEEV model? Name the key components. (4 points)**

The SEEV model is used to predict and explain how attention is allocated across different elements in a visual environment. The key components are:

S: Salience  
E: Effort  
E: Expectancy  
V: Value  

This model helps in understanding how various factors influence where a person is likely to direct their attention in a complex visual scene.

## INFORMATION VISUALISATION AND INFORMATION DASHBOARDS (12 POINTS)

### Part a)
**Imagine, your task is to design a student dashboard for the Deggendorf Institute of Technology (DIT). How can the SEEV model be employed in the dashboard design process? Elaborate with examples in 3-4 sentences. (4 points)**

The SEEV model can be employed in designing a student dashboard by ensuring that the most salient information, such as upcoming deadlines and important announcements, is prominently displayed. For instance, using bright colors or larger fonts for these elements can attract attention. Effort can be minimized by placing frequently accessed information, like course schedules and grades, in easily reachable areas. Expectancy and Value can be addressed by customizing the dashboard based on user preferences and highlighting features that provide the most benefit, such as quick links to frequently used resources.

### Part b)
**Name two main properties of an information dashboard. (2 points)**
1. Real-time data updates
2. Easy-to-read visualizations

### Part c)
**Examine the provided screenshot of a calculator app. Identify and name the design principle or approach that is evident in the visual representation. Please provide your answer in one word. (1 point)**

Alignment / Minimalism ?   

### Part d)
**What are the three important aspects of situational awareness? (3 points)**
1. Perception of the elements in the environment
2. Understanding
3. Anticipation

### Part e)
**Name two ways to improve the data-ink ratio in the following graph: (2 points)**
1. Remove unnecessary grid lines
2. Simplify or remove the background and borders around the bars / simplify color scheme.

USABILITY ENGINEERING (21 POINTS)

Let's solve the last part of the mock exam using the slide decks provided as references.

### Usability Engineering (21 Points)

#### Part a)
**What are the three evaluation dimensions of usability according to the definition? (3 points)**
1. Effectiveness
2. Efficiency
3. User satisfaction

#### Part b)
**The usability process can be broadly categorized into three stages: Analysis, Design, and Evaluation. Identify and name one usability method for each of these stages. (3 points)**
- Analysis: Personas & scenarios / User Interviews /  Field study
- Design: wire frames / rapid Prototyping
- Evaluation: Discount Usability / Questionnaires 

#### Part c)
**We have studied the seven principles of dialogue design. Provide the names of three of these principles. (3 points)**
1. Suitability for the user's tasks
2. Self- Discriptiveness
3. conformoty with user expectations
4. Learnability
5. Controllability
6. User Error Robustness
7. User Engagement

#### Part d)
**Elaborate on one of these principles in greater detail and provide a real-world example where this dialogue principle is implemented (3-4 sentences). (4 points)**

**Learnability:** The interactive system supports discovery of its capabilities and how to use them, allows exploration of the interactive system, minimizes the need for learning and provides support when learning is needed.
**Real World Example:** For example when choosing an element from a tool bar (i.e. Edit) of an application that you don't know much about, you get further choices when you choose that element for example "undo", "redo", "paste", so basically learnability is implimented when you can find a description of each of those sub elements when you right click on them for example. because some people may not know what does "paste" do, so they need a description to learn it's functionality.  

#### Part e)
**What is the main difference between Usability Inspection and Usability Tests? [< 10 words] (4 points)**
Experts vs. Real users
Main Difference: Usability Inspection involves experts evaluating a system based on established guidelines, whereas Usability Tests involve real users performing tasks to identify usability issues.

#### Part f)
**You are in the process of developing a fitness app aimed at tracking gym progress. After several interface iterations, you wish to assess its usability using a questionnaire. While seeking to evaluate overall user satisfaction, you also want to gauge system quality (usefulness), information quality, and interface quality. Which questionnaire would be the most appropriate choice? Please justify your selection in two to three sentences. (4 points)**

The most appropriate questionnaire would be the PSSUQ (Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire). The PSSUQ is designed to measure overall user satisfaction while also providing sub-scales that specifically evaluate system quality (usefulness), information quality, and interface quality. This makes it ideal for a comprehensive usability assessment of the fitness app.
